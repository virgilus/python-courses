    "# 📄 File Manipulation with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Opening and Managing Files\n",
    "\n",
    "This document explains how to manipulate files in Python, including opening, reading, writing, and closing files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Opening a File\n",
    "To open a file in Python, you can use the built-in `open()` function. This function takes two main arguments: the file name and the opening mode (read, write, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Open a file in read mode\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'r')\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Reading a File\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the file is opened, you can read its content using different methods, such as `read()`, `readline()`, or `readlines()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### With `read()`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Read all the file content\n",
    "content = file.read()\n",
    "print(content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### With `readline()`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Read one line at a time\n",
    "line = file.readline()\n",
    "while line:\n",
    "    print(line)\n",
    "    line = file.readline()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### With `readlines()`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Read all lines into a list\n",
    "lines = file.readlines()\n",
    "for line in lines:\n",
    "    print(line)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing to a File\n",
    "\n",
    "To write to a file, you must open it in write mode (`'w'`) or append mode (`'a'`). \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Open a file in write mode\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'w')\n",
    "file.write('This is a new line.\\n')\n",
    "file.write('Here is another line.\\n')\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Closing a File\n",
    "\n",
    "To close a file, you can use the `close()` method. It is important to close a file after using it to free system resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'r')\n",
    "# ... read or write operations ...\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Using with to Manage Files\n",
    "\n",
    "A safer and cleaner way to manage files in Python is to use the `with` statement, which ensures that the file is properly closed after use.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This avoids having to explicitly call `close()`, even in case of an error when reading or writing the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Case of Tabular Data: Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with tabular data, the Pandas library offers powerful features to read and write CSV, Excel files, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Read a CSV file\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv('example.csv')\n",
    "print(df)\n",
    "# Write a DataFrame to a CSV file\n",
    "df.to_csv('output.csv', index=False)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## The OS Library\n",
    "\n",
    "The `os` library in Python provides a way to interact with the operating system, including file and directory manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Listing Files in a Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the `os` module to list files in a directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "# List files in the current directory\n",
    "files = os.listdir('.')\n",
    "print(files)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But also to check the existence of a file or directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check if a file exists\n",
    "exists = os.path.exists('example.txt')\n",
    "print(exists)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sorting Files\n",
    "\n",
    "### By Name\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "# List and sort files in the current directory by name\n",
    "files = os.listdir('.')\n",
    "sorted_files = sorted(files)\n",
    "print(sorted_files)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### By Modification Date\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "from datetime import datetime\n",
    "# List and sort files by modification date\n",
    "files = os.listdir('.')\n",
    "sorted_files = sorted(files, key=lambda x: os.path.getmtime(x))\n",
    "for file in sorted_files:\n",
    "    mod_date = datetime.fromtimestamp(os.path.getmtime(file))\n",
    "    print(f\"{file} - Last modified: {mod_date}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### By Size\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "from datetime import datetime\n",
    "# List and sort files by size\n",
    "files = os.listdir('.')\n",
    "sorted_files = sorted(files, key=lambda x: os.path.getsize(x))\n",
    "for file in sorted_files:\n",
    "    size = os.path.getsize(file)\n",
    "    print(f\"{file} - Size: {size} bytes\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Moving or Renaming Files with shutil\n",
    "\n",
    "To move or rename files, you can use the same function: `shutil.move()` from the `shutil` module. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "import shutil\n",
    "# Move a file to a new directory\n",
    "shutil.move('file.txt', 'new_directory/file.txt')\n",
    "# Rename files using shutil\n",
    "shutil.move('old_name.txt', 'new_name.txt')\n",
    "```"

    "## 🎯 Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 In the **\"data/exo_files\"** folder. Write a script that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Moves files containing the word \"big\" in their name to a subfolder called \"big_files\". Sort them by size and rename them by adding their ranking as a prefix (number 1 being the largest file).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Moves files containing the word \"small\" in their name to a subfolder called \"small_files\". Sort them by modification date and rename them by adding their modification date as a suffix in YYYYMMDD format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tips:\n",
    "- Use the `os.makedirs()` function to create directories if necessary.\n",
    "- Use `os.path.getsize()` to get the file sizes.\n",
    "- Use `os.path.getmtime()` to get the modification dates of files.\n",
    "- Use the `datetime` module to format the modification date."
