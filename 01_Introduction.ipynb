Each processor has a clock that beats at a certain frequency and is measured in Giga Hertz (GHz), e.g. a 2.6 GHz processor has an internal clock that beats 2.6 billion times per second. Each beat represents an opportunity for the processor to manipulate a number of bits (32 bits or 64 bits). For now, let's remember that a bit is a unit that can take the value 0 or 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past, we used to compare the power of processors by looking at their frequency, but this is less true nowadays since processors have several \"cores\" allowing them to perform several operations simultaneously and thus multiplying their computing power. Certain architectures and techniques, such as \"hyperthreading\", which allows a chip to execute two sub-processes, play an important role in the final performance that a processor can achieve.\n",

    "Python is a language invented by a Dutch programmer while in his thirties, [**Guido Van Rossum**](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum), who was bored at his parents' house during the Christmas holidays of 1989. He continued to improve and perfect his language over the years before a whole community of programmers, as well as Google, began to assist him, attracted by the simplicity of this language.\n",
    "\n",
    "The name \"Python\" comes from the British comedy group the [Monty Python](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python), because \"Python\" was thought to be fun, just like the \"Monty Python\". Guido Van Rossum has stopped taking an active part in the development of Python in 2018, but he continues to give advices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a general-purpose language, it is sometimes said to be \"the 2nd best language in all fields\". Meaning that there are often more suitable languages to do a specific job, but Python is also likely to achieve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays Python is everywhere because it is very easy to learn and read. However, it has several flaws, the main one being its slowness: as Python is a high-level language, it takes a long time to translate its instructions into machine language (assemblor). However, this slowness is only noticeable when there are a large number of instructions to execute and/or the size of the data processed is very large."
