# Python course

Welcome to this Python course.

This repository contains a set of .ipynb files (readable with Jupyter Notebook / Lab or directly via github), as well as images and additional files. These notebooks will be useful for two types of person:

- Those who have never coded before, and will probably only be interested in doing the exercises classified as 'easy' and 'medium'.
- People who already have a decent level of programming experience, and will probably try to do the "difficult" exercises and read the end of the notebooks, which often contain more advanced concepts.
