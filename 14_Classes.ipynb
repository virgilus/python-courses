    "\n",
    "### *namespace*\n",
    "\n",
    "One of Python's subtleties is the *namespace*, i.e., a name space linked to entities. When you try to execute or access a function or attribute, Python first looks to see if an attribute (or method) has that name in a given space. Without going into too much detail, when you access an instance's attribute, Python goes from the specific to the general, so it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Looks if it's an **instance attribute** (it looks in the instance's *namespace*)\n",
    "1. If it doesn't find this attribute, it will then look if a **class attribute** has the same name (it looks in the class's *namespace*).\n",
    "1. If it doesn't find a class attribute either, then it returns **an error**.\n",
