    "A function can be recursive, meaning it can call itself while it's being executed.\n",
    "Write a recursive function named `quicksort()` that can perform a quick sort on a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input will be an unordered list of numbers and the ouput a list containing the same numbers but sorted in ascending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to perform a quick sort, we need to break this list down into three different groups using a \"pivot\" number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've chosen a pivot number to start with (it could be the first one in the list, the last one, the one in the middle, a random number, etc.), generate three new groups that we'll store in lists :\n",
    "\n",
    "- left \"**: in which you will place all numbers smaller than our pivot number.\n",
    "- middle \"**: in which you will place all numbers equal to our pivot number.\n",
    "- right \"**: in which you will place all numbers greater than our pivot number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then concatenate the lists in this exact order: `left + middle + right` to get the final ranked list. However, apart from the element(s) in the middle list, the elements inside the lists `left` and `right` will not be sorted. You will therefore need to apply the function recursively to the `left` list and the `right` list in order to rank them too.\n",
    "\n",
    "When there is only one item left to process in the list, simply return the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visual example with a quick sort *quick sort* which takes the last number as its pivot. However it is more common to take the middle of the list.\n",
