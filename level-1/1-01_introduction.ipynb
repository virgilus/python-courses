    "However, it is necessary to know a certain number of things about computers in order to understand the error messages returned by the various tools we are going to use, but also to become familiar with the vocabulary of computing.\n",

    "A computer works by using a large number of electronic components that communicate with each other: some are necessary and others are only optional."

    "<div>\n",
    "<img src=\"files/cpu.jpg\" alt=\"CPU\" width=\"400\" align='left'/> </div> The processor is the component of a computer that performs logical operations. Each processor has a clock (*clock*) that beats at a certain frequency and is measured in Giga Hertz (GHz), e.g. a 2.6 GHz processor has an internal clock that beats 2.6 billion times per second. Each beat represents an opportunity for the processor to manipulate a number of bits (32 bits or 64 bits). For now, let's remember that a bit is a unit that can take the value 0 or 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past, we used to compare the power of processors by looking at their frequency, but this is less true nowadays since processors have several \"cores\" (*cores*) allowing them to perform several operations simultaneously and thus multiplying their computing power. Certain architectures and techniques, such as \"hyperthreading\", which allows a chip to execute two sub-processes, play an important role in the final performance that a processor can achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, most people use computers with 64-bit processors with 4 to 8 cores and a frequency of 1.5 to 3 GHz.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more a processor is used, the more it heats up. To dissipate this heat it is necessary to add a radiator and a fan to it so that its temperature remains at an acceptable level (between 70°C and 100°C depending on the model)."

Until recently, the vast majority of hard drives were HDDs (Hard Disk Drives), shown on the left. It uses a technology similar to vinyl or CD-ROM: several platters (discs) rotate inside and are read by read heads. \n",

    "In recent years, these hard drives have been gradually replaced by SSDs (Solid-State Drives), pictured on the right, which work more like USB sticks, i.e. the data is stored in electronic memory components but is not erased when the drive is switched off. These drives are generally much faster, but are also more expensive than HDDs for the same capacity. With the development of cloud storage technologies and the *streaming* of audio and video streams, users tend to store less data on their hard drives, it is not necessary to have a large storage capacity to be able to use all the basic functions of a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, storage capacity has increased enormously in recent years. From a few Mo in the 1980s, HDDs sold in the market today often reach the size of 4 To (teraoctet) or 4 millions of Mo."

Most of the time, when a computer boots up, it displays the keys we need to press to access the BIOS.

    "    For example, \"Firefox\" is a software that includes a set of programs written in different languages (C, C++, JavaScript, CSS, Rust...). At the end, the source code is **compiled** in order to create a binary executable file which is written in machine language, i.e. in a language that can be understood by the computer's processor.\n",

    "    When programming using scripts, the approach is different: the source code is read step by step (and therefore compiled on the fly) by the computer which executes the instructions. So there is no executable file: the program and the source code are one.

When a web page is opened, the source code (often HTML, JavaScript and CSS) is interpreted by the browser which understands it and executes it line by line. There is no such thing as a \"google.exe\" file, but there is an HTML page which the source code is passed to the browser if you go to google.com.\n",

He continued to improve and perfect his language over the years before a whole community of programmers, as well as Google, began to assist him, attracted by the simplicity of this language.\n",

Guido Van Rossum has stopped taking an active part in the development of Python in 2018, but he continues to give advices.\n",

    "\n",
    "Nowadays Python is everywhere because it is very easy to learn and read. However, it has several flaws, the main one being its slowness: as Python is a high-level language, it takes a long time to translate its instructions into machine language (assemblor). However, this slowness is only noticeable when there are a large number of instructions to execute and/or the size of the data processed is very large."
